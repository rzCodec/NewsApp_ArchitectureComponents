# NewsApp_ArchitectureComponents

An app that uses a RESTful API to webscrape business and financial news. 
The user can save and view these news articles later or delete them. 

Technologies that I have learned from creating this app.

* MVVM Project Structure
* Designing a modern UI with Android Libraries such as Card and Recycler View
* SQL Queries with ROOM Database
* LiveData and ViewModels which separate business logic from the UI.
