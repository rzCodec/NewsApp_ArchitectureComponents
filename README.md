# NewsApp_ArchitectureComponents

Android app utilizing a RESTful API to webscrape business and financial news. 
The user can save and view these news articles for later references or delete them. 

Technologies that I have learned from creating this app.

* MVVM Project Structure
* SQL Queries with ROOM Database for data storage.
* LiveData and ViewModels which separate business logic from the UI, making development scalable and easier to locate bugs.
* Designing a modern UI with Android Libraries such as Card and Recycler View while following Material Design guidelines.
