# NewsApp_ArchitectureComponents

An Android app to view business and financial news.
The user can save and view these news articles for later references or delete them. 

Technologies that I have learned from creating this app.

* LiveData, ViewModels with MVVM Project Structure which separate business logic from the UI, making development modular, scalable and easier to locate bugs.
* Node.js Express RESTful API connecting to MongoDB Cloud Atlas Storage
* Retrofit which connects to the RESTful API to retrieve data. 
* Designing a modern UI with Android Libraries such as Card and Recycler View while following Material Design guidelines.
* ROOM Database to store news articles on the app.
